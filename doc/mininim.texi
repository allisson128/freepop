@chapter Movements
@cindex movements

In his journey to save the princess, the kid has to endure several
levels full of challenging traps and skilled opponents.  Run, walk,
turn, crouch, jump, hang, climb, take sword, attack, defend are some of
the kid's movements at your disposal to help him make his way to the
princess tower.  Although, this is a relatively large set of movements,
basically all these movements are accomplished by some combination of
the directional and shift keys, often conditioned to the current kid's
movement state.  This chapter explains in detail all possible movements
of the kid.

There are four major modes of movement: @dfn{normal}, @dfn{crouch},
@dfn{run} and @dfn{fight}.  The major mode the kid is in is the foremost
element determining how the input is translated into kid's movements.

@heading Normal

The major movement mode at the beginning of each level is normal.  While
in it the kid stands at rest.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-right}

If you press the horizontal directional key in the opposite direction
the kid is facing, he @strong{turns} and then faces the opposite
direction likewise.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-right} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-turn} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left}

Pressing the up directional key, makes the kid perform a
@strong{vertical jump}.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-vjump}

Pressing the up and the horizontal directional keys at once makes the
kid @strong{jump} forward.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-jump}

Pressing the horizontal directional key in the same direction the kid is
facing while holding the shift key, makes him @strong{walk} carefully.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-walk}


@heading Crouch

If you press the down directional the kid crouches.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-couch}

The kid stays crouched as long as you keep the down directional pressed.
If you press the horizontal directional key in the same direction the
kid is facing, without releasing the down directional, the kid performs
little @strong{crouching jumps} forwards.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-couch} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-couch-forward} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-couch}

Releasing the down directional makes the kid stand up again.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-uncouch} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left}


@heading Run

Pressing the horizontal directional key in the same direction the kid is
facing, makes him start to run.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-start-run}

He runs as long as you keep the directional key pressed.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-start-run} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-run}

In case you press the up directional key while running, he makes a
@strong{running jump}, and continue to run if you keep the horizontal
directional pressed.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-run} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-run-jump}

Instead, if you press the down directional key, he @strong{crouches}
slipping with some inertia, and then the crouching input rules apply.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-run} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-couch}

If you press the horizontal directional key in the opposite direction
the kid is facing while running, he @strong{turns} without stopping.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-run} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-turn-run}

He continues to run while you keep the directional pressed, but
releasing the directional key makes him stop, and go back to the normal
stage.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-stop-run} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left}


@heading Fight

If the kid has got the sword, the return key @strong{takes the sword}
and puts him in fight mode.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-take-sword} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-normal}

Pressing the horizontal directional key in the same direction kid is
facing, makes him @strong{walk forward}.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-normal} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-walkf}

Likewise if you press in the opposite direction, he @strong{goes
backward}.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-normal} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-walkb}

If you press the up directional, the kid makes the @strong{defense
movement}.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-normal} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-defense}

The shift key make him @strong{attack}.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-normal} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-attack}

Finally you can make him @strong{keep the sword} and return to normal
mode by pressing the down directional.

@center @image{mininim-figures/kid-sword-normal} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-keep-sword} @arrow{} @image{mininim-figures/kid-normal-left}
